## React RSS Feed Reader
This is a simple RSS feed reader web app built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The user can manage a customized list of RSS feeds, and links to recent articles from all subscribed feeds will be aggregated and shown on the home page. The user interface, built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), is clean and easy to use.

### Usage
To run this app, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Once you do,
1. Clone this repo and `cd` into its root directory
2. Run `yarn` to build dependencies
3. Run `yarn dev` to launch the app
4. In your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000` where the web app will be running
5. Navigate to the __Add Feeds__ page to add some RSS feed URLs
6. Navigate back __Home__ to see recent articles from your subscribed feeds
7. Enjoy!
